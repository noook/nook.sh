I'm a **full-stack software engineer** focused on building clean, maintainable web applications that actually help people.

I work mainly with **Vue/Nuxt**, **TypeScript**, and **PHP/Symfony**. Lately, I've been learning Rust, using it as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and efficient programming overall.

Over the past six years, I've worked in startups and larger teams, contributing to projects at **Bouygues Telecom**, **Beamy.io**, and **Golem.ai**, and currently building **Madami**, a platform supporting French non-profits.

Outside of work, I teach web development in Paris and occasionally contribute to open-source projects in the **Nuxt** ecosystem.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably motorcycling, DJing, tuning mechanical keyboards, or hanging out with my cat, **Lumo** üêà‚Äç‚¨õ.
